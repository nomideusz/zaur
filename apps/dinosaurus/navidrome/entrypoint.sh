# Both processes share the volume at /var/lib/navidrome:
#   $ND_MUSICFOLDER       — music library (Syncthing writes, Navidrome reads)
#   $ND_DATAFOLDER        — Navidrome's SQLite DB + caches
#   $ND_DATAFOLDER/syncthing — Syncthing's config/state (persists across deploys)
#
# Public exposure:
#   :$ND_PORT (default 4533) — Navidrome web UI + Subsonic API
#   :8384                    — Syncthing GUI (set up via env on first run)
#   :22000 TCP/UDP           — Syncthing peer sync (works through Syncthing's
#                              global relay network; we don't need a public
#                              port on Railway for it)
